description: '''
Adds a console ui superior to the built-in one and the ones provided by any other mods.
User-friendly interface, a good log panel, execution history, monospace font - all that is included in this mod.

In addiction to the console, this mod offers:
- An ability to save as many scripts as you want, execute them or copy to the console
- An ability to execute scripts when certain events get fired
- A full-blown file browser (be careful, you can cause real harm with that!)

See README.md for more info.
