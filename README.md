## Important notice
The mod is currently in development. Anything currently present in this mod is a subject for change or deletion.

## New Console
Mindustry mod that adds a better console ui

## Features
The mod adds a floating window with two buttons: one opens the console ui and the other allows you to drag the window across the screen.

The console ui consists of a scrollable output log in the left side and a multiline input field in the right.
There's also multiple buttons that allow you to clear the log,
see the scripts that were ran before, etc.

(More will be added in the future)

## Console history
The current script is saved to the history when you either run it or
press "next" / "prev".

You can navigate in the history by pressing "next" and "prev" in the console ui.

## Script
The input field in the right side allows you to write a multiline script
and run it by pressing the "run" button.

You can quicky clear this field by navigating to the latest script in the history.
This can be done by pressing the "next" button (you would have to press it multiple times
if you're currently navigating in the history).

## Scripts ui
You can open the scripts ui by opening the console and clicking on the "scripts" button in the right top panel.

In this menu you will see all the scripts that you have saved.
You can run, edit (copy to the console) or delete any scripts by pressing the respective buttons.

You can add the current script to the list by inputting a
name in the text field and pressing the "save" button in the left top corner.

# File browser
You can open the file browser by clicking on the "files" button.

The file browser is full-blown and allows you to perform most actions a real file browser allow you to perform.

The full list of features:
* Browse the file system
* Browse zip/jar files as if they were just normal directories (you can't modify them, though)
* Save the current script/text as a file
* Load text/code files into console
* Preview image files
* Create new directories
* Rename, copy, move and delete existing files
* More will be added in the next updates (let me rest qwq)
